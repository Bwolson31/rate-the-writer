# Rate The Writer

## Introduction
For our second project, we've created an innovative web application that allows registered users to rate writers. Our love for books was the motivation, 
so we created an app that helps users discover different authors.

### Features
You will be introduced to a login/signup page and go through user creation and authentication to access the application.
When logged in, there will be a homepage where a user can engage in conversation and can post/comment on the livefeed type page.

### User Story
